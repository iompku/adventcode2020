Advent of Code 2020

https://adventofcode.com/2020

Running in Python 3

Each day in December a new coding challenge is presented.

There are 2 parts to each challenge

First 11 scripts were done in terms of 
-Solve part 1
-Modify script to solve part 2

Sometimes Part 1 solution still prints out
Sometimes it is lost to history or commented out.

I might do 2 separate files from 12 onward for part 1 and 2 now that I'm uploading to Github.
